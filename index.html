    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Catch</h3>
    <p>
My project illustrates understanding of loops, classes and if statements. I created a class "ball" and placed multiple functions within it, including draw and move. I used an array list to contain all the miniature balls and used random variables to determine the sizes and colours of the balls. I also used the ball class to create the characteristics of the infected ball. If statements were placed to keep the miniature balls within the canvas and the infected ball the ability to loop around the canvas. The stage variables created different screens, a home screen and level one, with this feature I am able to create multiple extra levels if needed. The infected ball is controlled by the key pressed function, with the keys 'w'(up), 's'(down), 'a'(left), and 'd'(right). The small balls move in random directions and are bounced off the edges of the canvas with an if loop timesing the velocity by -1. A boolean was used so that when all the small balls had the infected colour then the game was completed. Finally, an if loop is used to ensure that when the timer has reached 30 seconds the game ends and the player has failed the level.

   <h3>Java Project 2022: Lost in Space</h3>
    <p>
I created a 2D platform game for my Java project. My game consists of a Spaceman (the main character), multiple enemies and collectibles. The spaceman is controlled with the keyboard and uses the mouse to shoot. My enemies include aliens, monsters and meteor showers. The aim of the game is to get collectibles, kill enemies and complete levels. I display stats of the spaceman, including lives and stars collected. If all lives of the spaceman are lost, then the game is over. Every level has  new platforms, background and music. I also have multiple GUI buttons such sd save, load, sound and exit. From this project I have developed my knowledge on encapsulation and my problem solving skill. During this project I struggled with finding platforms, sounds and characters that go with the theme of my game. Moreover, I fouond the understanding of some GUI buttons hard. Overall, I really enjoyed this course and learnt a lot about java.
